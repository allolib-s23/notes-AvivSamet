# Work Summary

This is a summary of my work in this class for this quarter

## City of Stars

https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-AvivSamet/blob/main/tutorials/audiovisual/Visual_Sine_Env_Demo.cpp

This is a transcription of City of Stars from La La Land. In this piece I was exploring the graphical component of Allolib and experimenting with modifying graphics and creating new ones. 
I was also attempting to create new abstractions for playing music, such as creating a playChord function.

## Untitled

https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-AvivSamet/blob/main/tutorials/synthesis/New_Demo.cpp

This is an original piece that I created for this class, I was going for a jazzy/video-gamey feel when I was creating this.
I iterated on this for most of the quarter so I've integrated a lot of concepts into this:
- Synthesizing new waveforms using square waves and sine waves
- Creating new graphics (such as the waveform in this piece) and modifying graphics from other demos
- Attaching SamplePlayer to a SynthVoice and using a SynthVoice to repeatedly play a sample instead of synthesizing a sound
- Further developing Allolib abstractions for playing music
- Using Allolib to play notes with more of a swing feel than a straight feel

## Good Group Voices

https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-AvivSamet/blob/main/tutorials/synthesis/Good_Group_demo.cpp

This is a piece that I've created as sort of a final project/demo. This is not a musical piece, this is meant to function more as an art piece or an exhibit.
I am part of A Good Group, a group on campus that promotes positive masculinity and seeks to create a nonjudgemental space for men to explore healthier forms of masculinity.
One of the things we do is that we take anonymous submissions about masculinity, and then record them and post them to social media. We do this in order to spread awareness.
If I were to develop this further, I would make a full exhibit where viewers are given some prompts and can submit their own thoughts to an anonymous writing portal, and select
submissions would then be automatically adapted and exhibited in the Allosphere. Viewers could then go into the Allosphere and observe the submissions being presented.

Some things I've explored in this piece:
- Allolib/the Allosphere as a tool for spreading social awareness
- The Allosphere as an art medium
- Creating graphics using audio from a Samplefile
- Using multiple meshes attached to the same voice
